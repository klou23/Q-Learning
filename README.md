# Q-Learning

### Pre-assignment Questions
1. Q Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the best action to take in the given state. The Q in Q-Learning stands for quality, which is how useful a given action is in achieving a goal. The learning means the algorithm improves, or learns, through iterations.
2. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning where an agent attempts to maximize a cumulative reward.
3. Q-learning doesn't require a model of the environment in order to run.
4. Q-learning is often used in news recommendations, where the reward is clicks/views/etc.

### Running the project

Run the main in Generator.java. This should generate a new maze, and then solve the maze, and print the Q matrix in the output.txt file.

### File descriptions

Generator.java - Generates a 3x3 maze and then uses the Solver class to solve it.
Solver.java -  Solves a 3x3 maze problem.
